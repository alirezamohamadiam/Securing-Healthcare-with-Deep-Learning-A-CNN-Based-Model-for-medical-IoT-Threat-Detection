# Securing Healthcare with Deep Learning: A CNN-Based Model for medical IoT Threat Detection

Welcome to the repository accompanying our paper, "Securing Healthcare with Deep Learning: A CNN-Based Model for medical IoT Threat Detection" This work was presented at the 2024 19th Iranian Conference on Intelligent Systems (ICIS) held from October 23-24, 2024 **(IEEE indexed Conference)**, at Sirjan University of Technology in Sirjan, Kerman, Iran.

## Achievements and Contributions

The proposed model achieved a perfect accuracy of 0.99 across binary, categorical, and multiclass classification tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

## Code Developer

Alireza Mohammadi 

## Project Overview

This repository includes the code and setup instructions for implementing our proposed CNN-based intrusion detection model for IoMT systems. The model performs multi-class classification on network traffic to distinguish between 19 attack types and benign traffic, based on the CICIoMT2024 dataset.

### Model Performance Metrics

| Model Classification Task | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Proposed Model (19 Class) | 0.99     | 0.98      | 0.99   | 0.98     |
| Proposed Model (2 Class)  | 0.99     | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |
| Proposed Model (6 Class)  | 0.99     | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |

Architecture of the CNN model for IoMT attack classification

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Required Libraries:** Install dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2. Data Preparation

**Dataset:**  
Download the "CIC IoMT dataset 2024" dataset in CSV format from [here](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iomt-dataset-2024.html)(details in README_DATA.md).
After downloading, extract and place the CSV files in the appropriate directories (`data/train/` and `data/test/`).

### 3. Training and Evaluation

Navigate to the `src` directory:
```bash
cd src
```

To run the model, execute `main.py` and specify the classification configuration:
```bash
python main.py --class_config <num_classes>
```

Replace `<num_classes>` with:
- **2** for binary classification,
- **6** for categorical,
- **19** for multiclass.

**Example (binary classification):**
```bash
python main.py --class_config 2
```

### Code Overview

- **data_loader.py**: Manages data loading, preprocessing, and splitting into training/testing sets.
- **model.py**: Defines the CNN architecture, including layers optimized for network traffic data.
- **main.py**: Executes training and evaluation processes based on specified configuration.
